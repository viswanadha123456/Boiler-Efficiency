# Boiler-Efficiency
Developed a comprehensive Power BI dashboard to analyze and track boiler performance across industrial units. The system monitored key metrics such as fuel usage, steam output, combustion characteristics, and efficiency ratio—enabling management to make accurate, real-time, data-driven decisions.

**Section 1 – KPI Cards:**
Avg Auxiliary Power (%)
Avg Condenser Pressure
Avg Efficiency (%)
Total Electrical Output
Total Fuel Input Energy
**Section 2 – Breakdown Charts:**
Bar chart: Avg Efficiency by Boiler Type
Column chart: Avg Efficiency by Fuel Type
Donut chart: Avg Efficiency by Ownership
Pie chart: Avg Efficiency by Region
Bar chart: Top 10 Power Plants by Efficiency
Scatter chart: Output vs Efficiency (with Boiler Type legend)
**Section 3 – Filter Panel:**
